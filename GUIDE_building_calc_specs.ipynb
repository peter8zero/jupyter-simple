    "We've all been there:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You write a 20-page spec with formulas\n",
    "- A developer implements it\n",
    "- Testing finds a bug... but is it in the spec or the code?\n",
    "- Nobody can tell because the spec formulas were never actually *run*\n",
    "- Hours of meetings to trace through the logic manually\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formulas are hidden in cells — hard to document\n",
    "- Cell references like `=B7*C12` are meaningless without context\n",
    "- Version control is painful\n",
    "- One accidental edit breaks everything\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Executable Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your spec document could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the actual calculation** with test data\n",
    "2. **Show each step** so everyone can follow along\n",
    "3. **Prove it works** before a developer ever sees it\n",
    "4. **Be the single source of truth** — one document, not spec + code + tests\n",
